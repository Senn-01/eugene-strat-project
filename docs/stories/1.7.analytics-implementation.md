# Analytics Implementation - Story 1.7

## Status
❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED** - Deferred to Story 1.9

## Rationale for Deferral

After strategic review, we decided to prioritize **Story 1.8 (DeepFocus Time-Boxing Enhancements)** before implementing analytics. This decision enables:

1. **Richer data collection**: Session goals, goal completion, and daily intentions provide more meaningful analytics
2. **Better user flow**: Users experience time-boxing benefits immediately, then analytics show the patterns
3. **Strava-like progression**: Build the "activity tracking" layer before the "performance dashboard" layer

## What Was Planned (Original Scope)

- Neo-brutalist analytics dashboard with purple/pink color system
- 2-week focused insights
- Project completion scatter plot
- Focus quality metrics
- Personal records showcase

## What's Happening Instead

**Story 1.8** implements time-boxing enhancements to DeepFocus:
- Session goals and completion tracking
- Daily intention ritual
- Today's activity feed
- Daily capacity meter

**Story 1.9** will implement revised Strava-inspired analytics:
- Session feed (last 7 days)
- Project segments (time invested per project)
- Weekly volume chart
- Time-of-day heatmap
- Strategic alignment analysis
- Personal records

## Next Steps

1. Complete Story 1.8 (DeepFocus Time-Boxing Enhancements)
2. Implement Story 1.9 (Analytics Strava Dashboard) with enriched session data
3. Gather user feedback on both features
