# UI Polish & Frontend Testing - TacticalMap Design System Compliance

## Status
**COMPLETED** - All TacticalMap UI polish and frontend testing requirements implemented

## Scope: TacticalMap Page Only

This story focuses exclusively on the **TacticalMap page** components and their neo-brutalist design with **yellow dominance**:
- ProjectModal (uses Yellow palette)
- ProjectActionsMenu (uses Yellow palette)
- AccuracyRatingSelector (uses Yellow palette)
- ProjectNode (uses Yellow palette)

**Note:** Other pages (DeepFocus, Analytics, Prime) maintain their own color schemes as defined in the design system and will be addressed in separate stories.

## Story

**As a** user and development team,
**I want** polished, consistent TacticalMap UI components that follow the yellow-dominant neo-brutalist design system,

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
**From Story 1.3 (Backend Database Integration):**
- ✅ Backend database integration established with real Supabase CRUD operations
- ✅ Optimistic updates and rollback mechanisms implemented
- ✅ Backend testing coverage achieved (70%+ for state management)
- ✅ Authentication context integration validated
- ⚠️ **UI Dependencies**: Frontend components now have stable backend to work with

### Design System Specifications
**Design Tokens** [Source: docs/front-end-specs/1-design-tokens-tailwind-v4-theme-configuration.md#11-17]:
- Primary colors: `--color-yellow-primary: #FDE047`, `--color-grey-crayon: #e8e8e6`
- Color system: `--color-tactical: #FDE047` (Yellow for TacticalMap page)
- Typography: System-ui font stack with black/bold weights for Neo-brutalist style

**Shadow and Border System** [Source: docs/front-end-specs/1-design-tokens-tailwind-v4-theme-configuration.md#50-58]:
- Standard borders: `--border-standard: 4px solid theme(colors.black)`
- Shadow patterns: `--shadow-base: 4px 4px 0px theme(colors.black)`
- Hover effects: `--shadow-hover: 6px 6px 0px theme(colors.black)`

**Icon Standards** [Source: docs/front-end-specs/3-universal-components.md#187-191]:
- Use Lucide React icons consistently
- Icon sizing: 16px standard, with proper styling
- No emoji icons in production interface components

### Component Architecture Context
**File Locations** [Source: docs/architecture.md#44-51]:
- Base path: `src/components/tactical-map/`
- Interactive components: `ProjectActionsMenu.tsx`, `AccuracyRatingSelector.tsx`, `ProjectModal.tsx`
- Main components: `TacticalMap.tsx`, `ProjectNode.tsx`

**Component Organization** [Source: docs/architecture.md#70-73]:
- Feature-based structure: Components grouped by domain
- Clear separation: UI concerns separated from backend logic
- TypeScript strict mode compliance with zero type errors

### Form UX Improvements Needed
**Business Terminology Issues** [Source: docs/stories/1.2.project-management-workflows.md#304-309]:
- Confidence labels currently use "Very Low/High" instead of proper business terms
- Status labels use incorrect terminology for project status
- Form copy needs review for clarity and proper terminology
- Modal layout too narrow and unclear compared to design specifications

**Modal Design Specifications** [Source: docs/front-end-specs/5-stacked-section-modal.md]:
- Modal dimensions: 700×700px (reduced width for better focus)
- Header: Background var(--color-tactical) yellow with proper title styling
- Body: Stacked section layout with clear visual hierarchy
- Actions: Yellow primary buttons with black borders and shadows

### Validation-Phase Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy** [Source: docs/front-end-specs/6-testing-strategy-validation-phase.md]:
- Smoke tests only: Focus on "does it work?" verification
- Integration tests: Test complete TacticalMap workflows with mocked backend
- Coverage target: 30% for validation phase (critical paths only)
- No unit tests: Component-level testing deferred to post-validation

**Testing Scenarios for Validation:**
- Core project CRUD operations (create, edit, complete, delete)
- Boss Battle toggle functionality
- Modal open/close behaviors
- Form validation with required fields
- XP calculation on project completion

**Test File Structure**:
```
src/__tests__/
├── integration/
│   ├── project-creation-workflow.test.tsx
│   ├── project-editing-workflow.test.tsx
│   ├── project-completion-workflow.test.tsx
│   └── boss-battle-workflow.test.tsx
└── smoke/
    ├── modal-operations.test.tsx
    ├── form-validation.test.tsx
    └── navigation.test.tsx
```

### Design System Violations to Fix
**Current Issues** [Source: docs/stories/1.2.project-management-workflows.md#296-302]:
- **Interactive Project Nodes**: Colors schema NOT respected (green, purple used instead of yellow/grey/crayon/black tactical map palette)
- **Interactive Project Nodes**: Cheap emojis used (✏️ ✅ ⭐) - should use classy Lucide icons following design system
- **Project Completion Workflow**: Colors don't follow neo-brutalist yellow-dominant palette for tactical map page
- **Project Modal**: Missing proper neo-brutalist styling consistent with page design

### Lucide Icon Mapping for TacticalMap
**Required Icon Replacements**:
- ✏️ (Edit emoji) → `<Edit size={16} />`
- ✅ (Check emoji) → `<Check size={16} />`
- ⭐ (Star emoji) → `<Star size={16} />`
- ✕ (Close emoji) → `<X size={16} />`
- Menu actions → `<MoreVertical size={16} />`

**TacticalMap Icon Implementation Pattern**:
```typescript
import { Edit, Check, Star, MoreVertical, X } from 'lucide-react'

// TacticalMap styling with yellow context
<Edit
  size={16}
  className="text-black hover:text-yellow-primary transition-colors"
  aria-label="Edit project"
/>
```

### Typography and Layout Standards
**Typography Classes** [Source: docs/front-end-specs/1-design-tokens-tailwind-v4-theme-configuration.md#82-119]:
- Headers: `.text-heading` with font-weight-black and uppercase
- Body text: `.text-body` with font-weight-bold
- Monospace data: `.text-mono` for XP and numeric displays

**Layout Patterns** [Source: docs/front-end-specs/5-stacked-section-modal.md]:
- Stacked section layouts for clear visual hierarchy
- 700px modal width for focused user experience
- Proper spacing using design token variables
- Vertical flow with section separation

## Testing

**Validation-Phase Testing Standards** [Source: docs/front-end-specs/6-testing-strategy-validation-phase.md]:
- **Test File Location**: Integration tests under `src/__tests__/integration/` and smoke tests under `src/__tests__/smoke/`
- **Test Framework**: Vitest with React Testing Library for user-centric testing
- **Mocking Strategy**: Mock Supabase operations (tested separately in Story 1.3), focus on TacticalMap UI workflows
- **Coverage Target**: 30% test coverage for validation phase focusing on critical user paths
- **Integration Testing**: Test complete TacticalMap workflows with mocked backend responses
- **No Unit Tests**: Component-level testing deferred to post-validation phase

**Validation-Phase Testing Requirements:**
- Core project CRUD workflows (create, edit, complete, delete)
- Boss Battle toggle functionality
- Modal open/close behaviors and form validation
- XP calculation verification on project completion
- Critical user path verification only
- Smoke tests for basic functionality

## Implementation Progress (2024-12-22)

### ✅ Completed Fixes

**Priority 1: Visual Hierarchy & Color Consistency**
- ✅ **Fixed project priority gold shadow logic** - Now correctly applies to `priority === 'must'` projects instead of boss battle projects (`ProjectNode.tsx:60`)
- ✅ **Fixed edit/complete button colors** - Updated to use yellow (`--color-tactical`) theme instead of green/pink (`globals.css:924-928`)
- ✅ **Replaced emoji star with Lucide icon** - Boss battle projects now use `<Star>` component with proper sizing and accessibility (`ProjectNode.tsx:66`)

**Priority 1: Modal UX Improvements**
- ✅ **Simplified ProjectModal layout** - Removed description field and moved tags under category selection for streamlined UX (`ProjectModal.tsx:203`)
- ✅ **Fixed completion modal color scheme** - Updated accuracy rating modal header to use yellow theme instead of pink (`globals.css:1634`)
- ✅ **Redesigned AccuracyRatingSelector** - Removed XP calculation display, replaced emoji stars with Lucide icons, simplified to feedback-only approach (`AccuracyRatingSelector.tsx:85-128`)

**Priority 2: Missing Components**
- ✅ **Created XP Gauge component** - Fixed-position gauge under header with real-time animation and Supabase data fetching (`XpGauge.tsx`, `layout.tsx:38`)
- ✅ **Added Focus/Visible toggle controls** - ChartHeader now includes toggle between "All" and "Focus" modes with proper visual states (`ChartHeader.tsx:56-73`)
- ✅ **Implemented focus mode dimming** - Inactive projects show at 40% opacity in focus mode instead of disappearing (`globals.css:777-784`, `TacticalMap.tsx:46`)

**Priority 2: Immediate XP Feedback**
- ✅ **Instant XP updates** - XP gauge increments immediately on project completion with lighting animation, no waiting for database (`AccuracyRatingSelector.tsx:34-55`, `globals.css:580-599`)

**Testing Implementation**
- ✅ **Smoke tests created** - Modal operations, form validation, and navigation smoke tests covering basic functionality (`src/__tests__/smoke/`)
- ✅ **Integration tests created** - Complete workflow tests for project creation, editing, completion, and boss battle functionality (`src/__tests__/integration/`)
- ✅ **Fixed React imports** - All test files properly import React to resolve compilation errors
