# Project Management Workflows - Brownfield Enhancement

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** strategic planner,
**I want** to click on project nodes to edit, complete, and prioritize them,
**so that** I can manage my project portfolio dynamically and track progress with XP rewards.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Builds on: Story 1 completed matrix display with project nodes and coordinate system
- Integrates with: Protected `/tactical-map` route, existing TacticalMap components, Supabase database operations
- Technology: Existing React components, TypeScript interfaces, established project fetching patterns
- Follows pattern: Feature-based component organization, established modal design system, state management patterns
- Touch points: Project node interactions, modal system integration, database CRUD operations, XP calculation

## Acceptance Criteria

**Interactive Requirements:**
1. Project nodes respond to click events opening context menu with options: Edit, Complete, Boss Battle Toggle
2. Edit option opens project modal with existing project data pre-populated for modification
3. Complete option displays accuracy rating selector (1-5 scale) and calculates XP: `cost × benefit × 10 × (boss_battle ? 2 : 1)`
4. Boss Battle toggle adds/removes gold star overlay on project nodes with visual feedback

**Modal Integration Requirements:**
5. Project editing modal uses same stacked section layout as creation but with "Update Project" title
6. Modal validation prevents position conflicts when updating cost/benefit coordinates
7. Form persistence maintains unsaved changes during validation errors with clear error messaging

**Database Requirements:**
8. All project updates persist to Supabase with proper RLS policy validation
9. Completed projects update status, accuracy_rating, xp_earned, completed_at timestamp
10. Boss Battle status toggle updates is_boss_battle field with immediate visual feedback

**Quality Requirements:**
11. State management follows established patterns from existing TacticalMap components
12. Component structure maintains feature-based organization under `components/tactical-map/`
13. No regression in existing functionality verified (matrix display, project rendering, authentication)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 1 (Core Matrix Display):**
- ✅ Matrix foundation is solid with 800×800px responsive containment
- ✅ Project nodes successfully implement category patterns and positioning
- ✅ Component structure established: `components/tactical-map/TacticalMap.tsx`, `ProjectNode.tsx`, `utils.ts`
- ✅ Coordinate system working: Direct pixel positioning with 80px grid spacing
- ✅ Integration with protected routing and database fetching validated
- ⚠️ **Technical Debt**: Sample data used in Story 1 - needs real Supabase integration for CRUD operations

### Data Models
**Project Interface** [Source: docs/prd-phase-2.md#182-200]:
```typescript
interface Project {
  id: string
  user_id: string
  name: string
  description: string
  cost: number // 1-10
  benefit: number // 1-10
  category: 'work' | 'learn' | 'build' | 'manage'
  priority: 'must' | 'should' | 'nice'
  status: 'active' | 'inactive' | 'completed'
  confidence: 'very_high' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low' | 'very_low'
  tags: string[]
  due_date?: string
  is_boss_battle: boolean
  accuracy_rating?: number // 1-5, only for completed projects
  xp_earned?: number // Calculated on completion
  created_at: string
  updated_at: string
  completed_at?: string
}
```

**Database Constraints** [Source: docs/prd-phase-2.md#117-147]:
- Unique constraint on (user_id, cost, benefit) WHERE status != 'completed'
- RLS policies: Users can only manage their own projects
- Cost/benefit: 1-10 range validation
- Accuracy rating: 1-5 range validation
- Boss Battle: Boolean field with default false

### State Management Patterns
**TacticalMap State Extension** [Source: docs/front-end-specs/8-state-management-patterns.md#6-59]:
```typescript
const useTacticalMapState = () => {
  const [projects, setProjects] = useState([])
  const [selectedProject, setSelectedProject] = useState(null)
  const [isModalOpen, setIsModalOpen] = useState(false)
  const [modalMode, setModalMode] = useState('create' | 'edit')
  const [bossBattleProject, setBossBattleProject] = useState(null)
  const [xpPoints, setXPPoints] = useState(0)

  const handleProjectEdit = (project) => {
    setSelectedProject(project)
    setModalMode('edit')
    setIsModalOpen(true)
  }

  const handleProjectComplete = (projectId, accuracyRating) => {
    const project = projects.find(p => p.id === projectId)
    const xpEarned = project.cost * project.benefit * 10 * (project.is_boss_battle ? 2 : 1)

    setXPPoints(prev => prev + xpEarned)
    setProjects(prev => prev.map(p =>
      p.id === projectId ? {
        ...p,
        status: 'completed',
        accuracy_rating: accuracyRating,
        xp_earned: xpEarned,
        completed_at: new Date().toISOString()
      } : p
    ))
  }

  const handleBossBattleToggle = (projectId) => {
    setBossBattleProject(prev => prev === projectId ? null : projectId)
    setProjects(prev => prev.map(p =>
      p.id === projectId ? { ...p, is_boss_battle: !p.is_boss_battle } : p
    ))
  }
}
```

### Modal Integration Specifications
**Bento-Style Modal Layout** [Source: docs/front-end-specs/5-bento-style-project-creation-modal.md#3-57]:
- Modal dimensions: 900×700px with responsive max-width/height
- Header: Background var(--yellow-primary) with "Edit Project" title for edit mode
- Body: Bento grid layout with same field structure as creation
- Actions: "Update Project" button instead of "Create Project"

**Form Validation** [Source: docs/front-end-specs/5-bento-style-project-creation-modal.md#95-105]:
- Required fields: name, cost, benefit, category, priority, confidence
- Coordinate conflict: Check existing projects excluding current project ID
- Form persistence: Maintain form state during validation errors
- Error recovery: Clear error messages with field focus

### XP Calculation Utilities
**XP Calculation Logic** [Source: docs/front-end-specs/9-utility-classes-helpers.md#191-207]:
```typescript
export const xpUtils = {
  calculateProjectXP: (cost, benefit, isBossBattle = false) => {
    const baseXP = cost * benefit * 10
    return isBossBattle ? baseXP * 2 : baseXP
  },

  formatXP: (xp) => xp.toLocaleString()
}
```

**Boss Battle Visual Implementation** [Source: docs/stories/story-1-core-matrix-display.md#114-117]:
- Star overlay: lines 265-278 in tacticalmap CSS
- Text shadow implementation for visibility
- Gold star with animation on hover

### File Locations
**Component Structure** [Source: docs/architecture.md#44-51]:
- Base path: `src/components/tactical-map/`
- Main component: `TacticalMap.tsx` (existing)
- Project node: `ProjectNode.tsx` (existing - needs click handlers)
- New components needed: `ProjectActionsMenu.tsx`, `AccuracyRatingSelector.tsx`
- Utilities: `utils.ts` (existing - extend with XP functions)

**Modal Integration** [Source: docs/architecture.md#44-51]:
- Existing modal patterns in: `components/auth/` directory
- Follow established component structure and TypeScript interfaces
- Modal state management: Use existing React patterns (useState/useContext)

### Testing Requirements

- Coverage target: 70% per technical standards

**Testing Scenarios**:
- Project node click interactions and menu display
- Modal edit functionality with pre-populated data
- XP calculation accuracy with various cost/benefit combinations
- Boss Battle toggle visual feedback and database persistence
- Coordinate conflict validation during project updates
- Error handling for failed database operations

### Technical Constraints
**TypeScript Standards** [Source: docs/prd-phase-2.md#62-67]:
- Strict mode compliance with zero type errors
- Component props interface definitions
- Database operation type safety

**Supabase Integration** [Source: docs/architecture.md#76-78]:
- Use existing client patterns from `lib/supabase/client.ts`
- RLS policy compliance for all operations
- Error handling for network failures

**Performance Considerations**:
- Optimistic updates for immediate UI feedback
- Efficient re-rendering with React.memo for project nodes

### Technical Debt

**System Integration:**
• **Database Integration**: Currently using sample data - needs Supabase integration for real CRUD operations
• **Authentication Context**: Need to connect with user authentication for `user_id` field
• **Real-time Updates**: No websocket/real-time updates for multi-user scenarios
• **Testing Coverage**: Basic utility tests exist, need comprehensive component testing
• **Unused Variables**: `totalXP` and `openCreateModal` prepared for future UI features

**Design System Violations:**
• **Interactive Project Nodes**: Colors schema NOT respected (green, purple used instead of yellow/grey/crayon/black tactical map palette)
• **Interactive Project Nodes**: Cheap emojis used (✏️ ✅ ⭐) - should use classy Lucide icons following design system
• **Project Completion Workflow**: Detailed XP calculation breakdown not requested - should be simple rating only
• **Project Completion Workflow**: Colors don't follow neo-brutalist yellow-dominant palette for tactical map page
• **Project Completion Workflow**: Completed projects don't disappear from matrix (likely due to hardcoded sample data)

**Form UX Issues:**
• **Project Modal**: Form layout too narrow and unclear - doesn't follow established UI patterns
• **Project Modal**: Missing proper neo-brutalist styling consistent with page design
• **Confidence Labels**: Wrong labels used ("Very Low/High" instead of proper "JCVD3", "Magna Cum", etc.)
• **Status Labels**: Incorrect terminology used ("Active/Paused" instead of proper project status labels)
• **Form Copy**: Almost all form text needs review for proper terminology and clarity

### Change Log
- **0.1.0**: Complete implementation of all interactive project management workflows per acceptance criteria

### Status
Ready for Review
