# Executive Summary

Eugene Strat's front-end implements a **Neo-Brutalist Professional Minimalism with Organic Warmth** design philosophy built on **Tailwind CSS v4 + React 19 + Next.js 15**. The interface eliminates cognitive friction through visual clarity, enabling strategic decision-making via a cost/benefit matrix visualization. Key characteristics include 4px black borders, aggressive shadows, bold typography, and hand-drawn grid effects that feel "drawn with pencil" while maintaining professional impact.

**Core Principle**: Strategic thinking through visual clarityâ€”no progressive disclosure, no hidden complexity, immediate helicopter view of project landscape.

**Technology Alignment**: This specification aligns with `docs/architecture.md` modern stack: Tailwind CSS v4 (5x faster builds, P3 color support), React 19 (ref as standard prop), and Next.js 15 App Router patterns for optimal performance and developer experience.
