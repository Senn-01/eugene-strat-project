# Eugene Strat

**The Strava of Project Management** - A professional strategic visual planning tool that combines visual project prioritization with performance analytics to help you understand your strategic patterns and improve your execution practice.

## Core Vision: The Strava of Project Management

Just as Strava transforms running data into insights and motivation, Eugene Strat transforms your project work into strategic clarity and performance improvement.

**Strategic Meta-Layer Philosophy:**
Create a visual layer above traditional task management tools, focusing on the bigger picture and strategic patterns rather than managing granular details.

**Two Core Functions:**
- **STRATEGIC MAP**: Visual cost/benefit matrix for portfolio-level decision-making
- **PERFORMANCE ANALYTICS**: Track your strategic patterns and execution effectiveness over time

The tool enables the **strategic pause** before executionâ€”deliberately assessing cost/benefit/priority before committing to track projects, creating visual clarity for better strategic decisions.

## Key Features

âœ… **TacticalMap** (Complete): Interactive cost/benefit matrix for visual project prioritization
- Real-time project CRUD operations with optimistic updates
- Boss Battle system with 2x XP multipliers for priority projects
- Category-specific visual patterns (Work: dots, Learn: stripes, Build: grid, Manage: lines)
- Focus/Visible toggle system for strategic attention management
- Business terminology confidence levels (JCVD, Magna Cum, Gut Feel, etc.)

âœ… **DeepFocus** (Complete): Gamified deep work sessions with willpower tracking
- Complete timer functionality (60/90/120 minutes) with persistence across navigation
- Willpower assessment system with Duke Nukem difficulty quotes
- Post-session mindset feedback ("Shaolin mode!", "Getting there", "What the heck is the zone?")
- XP rewards with variable multipliers based on willpower and duration
- Daily commitment slider with progress tracking
- Sound notifications for session completion
- Session interruption handling (10 XP reward)
ðŸ”„ **Analytics** (Planned): Strava-inspired performance insights with heatmaps and achievements
ðŸ”„ **Prime** (Future): Personal operating system with values definition
âœ… **XP System** (Complete): Gamified rewards with immediate visual feedback
ðŸ”„ **Universal Capture** (Planned): GTD-inspired brain dump with CMD+K activation

## Getting Started

1. Set up Supabase project and add environment variables to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

2. Install dependencies and run development server:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the authentication page

## Strategic Vision

Eugene Strat represents a new category: **Strategic Project Analytics**. Like how Strava transformed running from a simple activity into a data-driven practice with community insights, Eugene Strat transforms project management from reactive task completion into strategic, visual decision-making with performance improvement.

The goal is not to replace your task managerâ€”it's to create the strategic layer that helps you choose *which* projects deserve your focus, and then track how well your strategic instincts align with reality over time.
