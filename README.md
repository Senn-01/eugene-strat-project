# Eugene Strat

**The Strava of Project Management** - A professional strategic visual planning tool that combines visual project prioritization with performance analytics to help you understand your strategic patterns and improve your execution practice.

## Core Vision: The Strava of Project Management

Just as Strava transforms running data into insights and motivation, Eugene Strat transforms your project work into strategic clarity and performance improvement.

**Strategic Meta-Layer Philosophy:**
Create a visual layer above traditional task management tools, focusing on the bigger picture and strategic patterns rather than managing granular details.

**Two Core Functions:**
- **STRATEGIC MAP**: Visual cost/benefit matrix for portfolio-level decision-making
- **PERFORMANCE ANALYTICS**: Track your strategic patterns and execution effectiveness over time

The tool enables the **strategic pause** before executionâ€”deliberately assessing cost/benefit/priority before committing to track projects, creating visual clarity for better strategic decisions.

## Key Features

âœ… **TacticalMap** (Complete): Interactive cost/benefit matrix for visual project prioritization
- Real-time project CRUD operations with optimistic updates
- Boss Battle system with 2x XP multipliers for priority projects
- Category-specific visual patterns (Work: dots, Learn: stripes, Build: grid, Manage: lines)
- Focus/Visible toggle system for strategic attention management
- Business terminology confidence levels (JCVD, Magna Cum, Gut Feel, etc.)

ðŸ”„ **DeepFocus** (Planned): Gamified deep work sessions with willpower tracking
ðŸ”„ **Analytics** (Planned): Strava-inspired performance insights with heatmaps and achievements
ðŸ”„ **Prime** (Future): Personal operating system with values definition
âœ… **XP System** (Complete): Gamified rewards with immediate visual feedback
ðŸ”„ **Universal Capture** (Planned): GTD-inspired brain dump with CMD+K activation

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** with App Router and React 19
- **TypeScript 5** with strict mode
- **Supabase** for authentication and database
- **Tailwind CSS v4** with neo-brutalist design system
- **Framer Motion v11** for animations
- **Recharts v2** for data visualizations

## Current Progress

âœ… **Phase 1 Complete** - Authentication Foundation:
- Supabase email/password authentication with protected routing
- Four authenticated pages with navigation: `/tactical-map`, `/deep-focus`, `/analytics`, `/prime`
- Neo-brutalist design system with page-specific header colors (Yellow for TacticalMap)
- Universal 2Ã—2 navigation grid with active states
- Desktop-optimized responsive design (1024px minimum)

âœ… **Phase 2 Complete** - TacticalMap Strategic Visualization:

**Strategic Matrix & Project Management:**
- âœ… Interactive 800Ã—800px cost/benefit positioning matrix
- âœ… Real-time project CRUD with Supabase integration and optimistic updates
- âœ… Project nodes with category-specific visual patterns (Work: dots, Learn: stripes, Build: grid, Manage: lines)
- âœ… Four strategic quadrants with clear positioning logic
- âœ… Priority-based visual hierarchy (gold shadows for "Must" priority projects)

**Gamification & User Experience:**
- âœ… Boss Battle system with star indicators and 2x XP multipliers
- âœ… XP system with immediate visual feedback and lighting animations
- âœ… Chart header with Focus/All toggle for attention management
- âœ… Simplified project creation modal (streamlined for rapid entry)
- âœ… Business terminology throughout (JCVD confidence levels, Focus/Visible status)

**Technical Foundation:**
- âœ… Complete database schema with RLS for projects, user_preferences, captures
- âœ… Lucide React icons replacing all emoji for professional interface
- âœ… Yellow-dominant neo-brutalist design with consistent shadows and borders
- âœ… Validation-phase testing with 30% coverage of critical user paths
- âœ… TypeScript strict mode with comprehensive type safety

ðŸš€ **Next Phase** - Universal Components & Global CSS Refactoring:
- Page-specific neo-brutalist color adaptation for all pages
- Breaking down 1800+ line globals.css into modular stylesheets

## Getting Started

1. Set up Supabase project and add environment variables to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

2. Install dependencies and run development server:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the authentication page

## Strategic Vision

Eugene Strat represents a new category: **Strategic Project Analytics**. Like how Strava transformed running from a simple activity into a data-driven practice with community insights, Eugene Strat transforms project management from reactive task completion into strategic, visual decision-making with performance improvement.

The goal is not to replace your task managerâ€”it's to create the strategic layer that helps you choose *which* projects deserve your focus, and then track how well your strategic instincts align with reality over time.
